# 🖥 System Monitor Tool (Linux)

A C++17 console-based real-time System Monitoring Tool built for Linux.  
This project displays CPU usage, memory usage, uptime, and active processes — similar to the Linux top command.  
It was developed as part of the Wipro On-Campus Capstone Project (2025) under Linux OS & LSP modules.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a lightweight and efficient system monitoring tool using C++ that interacts directly with the Linux /proc filesystem.

This tool provides:
- CPU Utilization Percentage
- Memory Usage (Total, Used, Available)
- Active Process List (PID, Command, Memory, CPU Time)
- System Uptime
- Auto Refresh every 2 seconds

---

## ⚙ Features

✅ Real-time CPU and memory statistics  
✅ Process table with PID, Command, RSS (Memory in KB), and CPU Time  
✅ Clear, formatted, and auto-updating display  
✅ Built using only system calls and C++ standard libraries  
✅ Modular architecture (separate header & source files)  
✅ Easy to compile with Makefile  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Language | C++17 |
| Environment | Ubuntu (via WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux) |
| Build Tool | GNU Make |
| Editor | Visual Studio Code |
| System Interface | /proc filesystem (cpuinfo, meminfo, stat, uptime) |
